## Project Overview

**Sitara Web Companion** is a comprehensive, feature-rich web application designed to serve as an auxiliary interface or helper tool, potentially for a larger system or as a standalone productivity companion. The primary goal is to seamlessly integrate with existing workflows, enhance user productivity, automate routine tasks, and provide an extensible platform for future enhancements.

---

## Features

- **Modern User Interface**: Intuitive, responsive UI built with React and TypeScript, adhering to best UX practices.
- **Task Automation**: Automate repetitive or routine workflows through customizable scripts or triggers.
- **Integration-Ready**: Easily connect with external APIs, services, or databases.
- **Real-time Notifications**: Instant feedback and alerts for key events or actions.
- **User Authentication & Authorization**: Secure login, role-based access, and session management.
- **Customization & Theming**: Supports light/dark modes and user-customizable settings.
- **Error Handling & Logging**: Robust error boundaries, centralized logging, and developer-friendly debug tools.
- **Accessibility**: Built with accessibility (a11y) in mind to ensure usability for all users.
- **Internationalization**: Structure in place for multi-language support.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (94.3%), [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) (3.2%)
- **Styling**: [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) (1.3%)
- **Framework**: [React](https://react.dev/) (presumed)
- **Build Tools**: [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) or [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) (depending on setup)
- **State Management**: [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) or Context API (if present)
- **Testing**: [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)
- **Linting & Formatting**: [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- **CI/CD**: [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) (if configured)
- **Other**: See `package.json` for a full list of dependencies.

---

## Architecture Overview

The project follows modern frontend architecture patterns, including:

- **Component-Based Design**: UI is split into reusable, isolated components.
- **Container-Presenter Pattern**: Separates data-fetching/container logic from presentational components for maintainability.
- **Hooks**: Uses React Hooks for state, effect, and context management.
- **Modular Codebase**: Clear separation of concerns—components, utilities, styles, and types.
- **API Layer**: Centralized modules for all HTTP requests and data fetching.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 16.x or higher recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nixzouxu/sitara-web-companion.git
   cd sitara-web-companion
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

### Environment Configuration

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the required environment variables.
  ```bash
  cp .env.example .env
  ```

- Common variables may include:
  - `REACT_APP_API_URL`
  - `REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID`
  - (Refer to the sample file and documentation for details.)

### Running the App

- **Development mode**
  ```bash
  npm start
  # or
  yarn start
  ```

- **Production build**
  ```bash
  npm run build
  # or
  yarn build
  ```

### Available Scripts

- `start` – Launches the application in development mode.
- `build` – Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
- `test` – Runs all tests using Jest and React Testing Library.
- `lint` – Checks code quality with ESLint.
- `format` – Formats the codebase with Prettier.
- `eject` – (If using Create React App) Ejects the configuration.

## Design Decisions

- **TypeScript-First**: The project leverages TypeScript for type safety, maintainability, and better developer experience.
- **Modularity**: Each module/component is self-contained for reusability and testability.
- **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML and ARIA attributes are used to maximize accessibility.
- **Performance**: Code splitting and lazy loading are considered for optimal bundle sizes.
- **Testing**: Emphasis on unit and integration tests to ensure reliability and prevent regressions.
